function [t,w] = rk4sys(f,range,iv,h)
% input f is a vector valued function containing the system of differential equations
%       f takes t and w as inputs, where w is an array containing the dependent variables
%       the output f should be organized as a row vector
% input range is a vector of length 2 containing an initial time and a final time
% input iv is a vector containing the initial conditions for each dep variable
% input h is a scalar step size
% output t is a column vector containing the times at which we have solution approximations
% output w is a matrix whose columns are the approximations of the different dep variables

%set up an evenly spaced array for t
t = (range(1):h:range(2))';

% Preallocate the solution matrix w.  Use the length of t to determine the number of time steps 
% and the length of iv to determine the number of functions/ODEs.
% Make sure the matrix is tall, not wide.  That is, each column of w should represent one function.
w = zeros(length(t), length(iv));

%input the initial conditions into the first row of w
w(1,:) = iv;

%run through the RK4 method to fill in the remaining rows of w
for i = 1:length(t) -1
    k1 = h*f(t(i),w(i,:));
    k2 = h*f(t(i) + h/2,w(i,:) + k1/2);
    k3 = h*f(t(i)+h/2,w(i,:)+k2/2);
    k4 = h*f(t(i)+h,w(i,:)+k3);
    w(i+1,:) = w(i,:) + (1/6)*(k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4);
